# Running locally

Before you start make sure you have Ruby and the gems for Jekyll installed locally. You can find out how to do that here.

1. Clone your resume repository locally (if you haven't already)
2. cd [your-repository-name]
3. bundle install
4. bundle exec jekyll serve
5. Open your browser to http://localhost:4000

Any changes you make will automatically build and you will be able to see these by refreshing your browser.

*Note: You will need to re-run bundle exec jekyll serve to see changes made in _config.yml.*
